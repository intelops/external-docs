If you are willing to contribute to KubViz, kindly follow the guidelines
here [contributors](https://github.com/intelops/kubviz/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md). Thank you for your contribution!

## Contributing to the docs

- The best way to get started is by reading
  the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/intelops/kubviz/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md).
- Afterwards, go ahead and **fork** the compage [repository](https://github.com/intelops/kubviz.git). Make any changes you
  want to your fork, and when you're ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request.

- If it takes longer than expected to get feedback from the `KubViz by IntelOps` team, head over to
  the [Discord Server](https://intelops.ai/) and **ping** a IntelOps staff member either in the `#general`
  or `#feedback` channel, unless you are a member of the private `contributor` channel. You can always request access to
  this channel.

- Once your pull request has been opened, it will be assigned to one or more reviewers. Those reviewers will do a
  thorough code review, looking for correctness, bugs, opportunities for improvement, documentation, comments, and
  style.

- Make sure you include relevant updates or additions to documentation when creating or modifying features. Once youâ€™ve
  received review and approval, your commits are squashed, and your PR is ready for merging.

- Congrats youâ€™re officially a KubViz contributor ðŸŽŠ
