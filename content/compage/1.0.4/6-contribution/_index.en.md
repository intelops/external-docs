If you are willing to contribute to Compage, kindly follow the guidelines
here [contributors](https://github.com/intelops/compage/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Thank you for your contribution!

## Contributing to the docs

- The best way to get started is by reading
  the ["Contributor.md"](https://www.compage.dev/blog/how-to-contribute-to-compage?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=referral)
  along with the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/intelops/compage/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- The docs are in the code repository itself under /docs directory. The documentation is created using based on famous
  framework `Docusaurus`.
- Afterwards, go ahead and **fork** the compage [repository](https://github.com/intelops/compage). Make any changes you
  want to your fork, and when you're ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request.

- If it takes longer than expected to get feedback from the `Compage by IntelOps` team, head over to
  the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DeapQc22qe) and **ping** a IntelOps staff member either in the `#general`
  or `#feedback` channel, unless you are a member of the private `contributor` channel. You can always request access to
  this channel.

- Once your pull request has been opened, it will be assigned to one or more reviewers. Those reviewers will do a
  thorough code review, looking for correctness, bugs, opportunities for improvement, documentation, comments, and
  style.

- Make sure you include relevant updates or additions to documentation when creating or modifying features. Once youâ€™ve
  received review and approval, your commits are squashed, and your PR is ready for merging.

- Congrats youâ€™re officially a Compage contributor ðŸŽŠ
