4. Create cluster

For creating the cluster, execute below command

```bash
./capten create cluster --cloud=<cloudtype> --type=talos
```

Note: Cloud type supported are 'aws' and 'azure'

* Cluster Creation through Docker Container:

For creating the cluster through docker container (needed in case of using Capten CLI distribution on Windows or MacOS ),run the below command

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/aws_config.yaml:/app/config/awsorazure_config.yaml -it ghcr.io/intelops/capten:<latest-image-tag>  create cluster --cloud=aws --type=talos
```

Post cluster creation, `kubeconfig` will be generated to `./config/kubeconfig`.
Access cluster using generated kubeconfig with kubectl

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/home/capten/config/kubeconfig
kubectl get nodes
```

#### Setting up the cluster applications

For deploying the cluster applications, execute below command

```bash
./capten setup apps
```

Capten CLI will deploy Capten application suite and Capten Agent on Controlplane cluster.
Post application deployment, mTLS certificates are generated to access Capten Agent. mTLS certificates `capten-client-auth-certs.zip` generated in `cert` folder.

Deployed applications can be listed with helm tool

```bash
helm list -A
```

#### Show the cluster info

```bash
./capten show cluster info
```
#### Update DNS entry 

Add record updating the domain name in `./config/capten.yaml` and LB host in `./config/capten-lb-endpoint.yaml` to  any dns so that applications could be exposed.

#### Destroying the cluster

Cluster destruction command initiates the process of removing all components associated with the cluster, such as virtual machines, instances, nodes, networking configurations, and any other resources provisioned for the cluster. It effectively undoes the setup and configuration of the cluster, deallocating resources and ensuring they are no longer in use. This command can be used when the cluster is no longer needed or to clean up resources in cloud computing, distributed systems, or container orchestration environments.

```bash
./capten destroy cluster
```
